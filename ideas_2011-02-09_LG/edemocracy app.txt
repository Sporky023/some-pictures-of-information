Design proposal for a simple e-democracy app:

QUESTION PIPELINE
  - users can see a list of upcoming questions
  - how are questions added to the pipeline?
  - is there a mechanism for bringing questions closer to the front of the pipeline? i.e. pushing a question to the top?

HOW TO HOLD A VOTE
  - phone buzzes from push notification
  - a question or decision is presented on the phone
  - there is a deadline to respond
  - big buttons for "yes" and "no"
